The application must be able to perform a search for movie names, series and personalities from the API [The movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) (version 3). A filter must allow selection of results in one of these categories.

In addition, when selecting one of the films, series and/or characters sought, the application must, on another screen, present the information obtained through the API about the record in question.
